# Face Recognition Security App


1. You have to register and add photos of known people with their names to the database.

2. Now we start the camera. 

First it is will use face detection to detect the faces in the frame and then it will use Face
Recognition to identify the face. If the face doesn't matches with any of the faces in the database it will send a mail to the user that a unknown person has been detected by the camera.
